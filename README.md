Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The idea for this project is to create a functionining program that predicts the chances of catching fish. Packed into a pretty GUI on a mobilephone, this program would revolutionize the way fishing hobbyist fish all across the globe.

## Background

Personally I have had many negative experiences with fishing, because it seems I can't ever catch anything. With this program people like me would have a better chance of catching a fish. I believe this is a common problem and the solution here would encourage people to go outdoors and catch their own meals.

## How is it used?

A user would open the app from his/her phone and see a map or a bot that suggests an area where the chances of catchin a fish would be the most probable. The app would also work as an input for new data, thus improving the results of the predictions(by logging information where the user caught fish, what time it was, weather condition, equipment etc.).
The solution would be purely to help any person to find a good fishing spot.


## Data sources and AI methods

The data would be gathered from global databanks(maps, fish population per lake, equipment rating) and users(experiences, locations, time). This would be the hardest part to figure out in this project. An algorithm that takes all these coefficents or weights in conciredation in a fluent and reliable way is not simple. Now I believe the best course of action would be to gather information from professional fishers aswell as form hobbyists on equipment, location etc and give these attributes values and use it as training data. After trial and error, the program could potentially work great.

## Challenges

The program would not guarantee a catch, but rather give a precise guess by the AI what the probability is for catching fish in any given lake. I guess ethically the lives of many fish would be lost in the success of this project. A functioning internetconnection would be required for this to work, so the application would not necessarely work in remote locations, so people would need to plan their fishing spots beforehand.

## What next?

As described above, the assistance of professional/hobby-fishers would be beneficial. The weights/coefficients of data would be firstmost thing to do. Also for a pretty GUI a person with a good eye for graphical design.
